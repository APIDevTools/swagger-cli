Features
--------------------------
- Validate Swagger 2.0 APIs in **JSON or YAML** format
- Supports multi-file APIs via `$ref` pointers
- Bundle multiple Swagger files into one combined Swagger file
- Built-in **HTTP server** to serve your REST API &mdash; great for testing!


Installation
--------------------------
Install using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm):

```bash
npm install -g swagger-cli
```


Usage
--------------------------

```bash
swagger <command> [options] <filename>

Commands:
    validate                        Validates a Swagger API against the Swagger 2.0 schema and spec

    bundle                          Bundles a multi-file Swagger API into a single file

    serve                           Serves a Swagger API via the built-in HTTP REST server

Options:
    -h, --help                      Show help for any command
    -V, --version                   Output the CLI version number
    -d, --debug [filter]            Show debug output, optionally filtered (e.g. "*", "swagger:*", etc.)
```


### Validate an API

The `swagger validate` command will validate your Swagger API against the [Swagger 2.0 schema](https://github.com/reverb/swagger-spec/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json) _and_ the [Swagger 2.0 spec](https://github.com/reverb/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) to make sure it is fully compliant.  The command will exit with a non-zero code if the API is invalid.

```bash
swagger validate [options] <filename>

Options:
    --no-schema                     Do NOT validate against the Swagger 2.0 schema

    --no-spec                       Do NOT validate against the Swagger 2.0 spec
```


### Combine Multiple Files

The Swagger 2.0 spec allows you to split your API across multiple files using [`$ref` pointers](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#reference-object) to reference each file. You can use the `swagger bundle` command to combine all of those referenced files into a single file, which is useful for distribution or interoperation with other tools.

By default, the `swagger bundle` command tries to keep the output file size as small as possible, by only embedding each referenced file _once_.  If the same file is referenced multiple times, then any subsequent references are simply modified to point to the _single_ inlined copy of the file.  If you want to produce a bundled file without _any_ `$ref` pointers, then add the `--dereference` option.  This will result in a larger file size, since multiple references to the same file will result in that file being embedded multiple times.

If you don't specify the `--output-file` option, then the bundled API will be written to stdout, which means you can pipe it to other commands.

```bash
swagger bundle [options] <filename>

Options:
    -o, --outfile <filename>        The output file

    -r, --dereference               Fully dereference all $ref pointers

    -f, --format <spaces>           Formats the JSON output using the given number of spaces
                                    (the default is 2 spaces)
```


### HTTP REST Server

The `swagger serve` command serves your REST API via the built-in HTTP server &mdash; [Swagger Server](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-server).  Swagger Server automatically provides mock implementations for every operation defined in your Swagger API.  You can replace or supplement the mock implementations via [Express middleware](http://expressjs.com/guide/using-middleware.html).

By default, Swagger Server uses an [in-memory data store](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-express-middleware/blob/master/docs/exports/MemoryDataStore.md), which means no data will be persisted after the server shuts down. This is great for testing and CI purposes, but if you want to maintain data across sessions, then use the `--json` option, which will persist the REST resources as [JSON files](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-express-middleware/blob/master/docs/exports/FileDataStore.md).

> NOTE: Swagger Server is still in development, so some functionality is not fully complete yet.

```bash
swagger serve [options] <filename>

Options:
    -p, --port <port>               The server port number or socket name

    -j, --json <basedir>            Store REST resources as JSON files under the given directory
```
